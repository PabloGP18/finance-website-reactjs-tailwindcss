# React JS & Tailwind CSS Mobile Responsive Website

This project demonstrates the construction of a 100% mobile responsive website from scratch using React JS and Tailwind CSS.

## Overview

In this project, I have leveraged the power of React JS and Tailwind CSS to create an aesthetic, mobile-responsive website. It serves as a practical demonstration of using some of the popular libraries in modern web development.

## Key Features

### Tailwind CSS and Vite

I used Vite, a next-generation front-end tooling platform, to bootstrap this project. It offers faster build speed, out-of-the-box features, and a superior developer experience. I've also incorporated Tailwind CSS into this Vite setup, allowing for utility-first styling of the application.

### React-Typed

I integrated "React-Typed", a useful React package, to add text animation in the Hero component, providing an interactive and dynamic element to the website.

### UseState Hook

React's useState hook was used to implement a toggle feature for the mobile side drawer menu. This functionality enhances the site's navigation and the mobile user experience.

### React-Icons

The project includes the "React-Icons" library, which gives a wide selection of scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS.

### Layouts

Throughout the project, both flexbox and grid layouts were employed. These CSS layout modules are an efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container.

## Conclusion

At the end of this project, I've learned how to build a fully functioning, mobile-responsive website from scratch using React JS, Tailwind CSS, and Vite. This project has been a testament to the power and versatility of these tools in modern web development.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project, and happy coding!
